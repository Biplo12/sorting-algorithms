## Sorting Algorithms Visualization

This project is a simple representation of how various sorting algorithms work. It provides a visual demonstration of how different algorithms sort an array of elements. The web application displays a graphical representation of the array as bars, and users can select different sorting algorithms to observe their effects on the array.

### Features

- Randomly generated array represented as bars
- Buttons for selecting popular sorting algorithms
- Dynamic visualization of sorting algorithm execution
- Regenerate array button to generate a new random array
- Stop button to halt the sorting process

### Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:

- Vite: A fast web development build tool that provides a modern development workflow.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling and layout.

### Getting Started

To use this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running the command `yarn install`.
4. Start the development server with the command `yarn dev`.
5. Open your web browser and visit the URL provided by the development server.

### Usage

Once the web page is loaded, you can interact with the application as follows:

1. **View the Initial Array**: The array is represented by bars on the screen, where each bar's height corresponds to the value in the array.
2. **Choose a Sorting Algorithm**: Click on any of the sorting algorithm buttons (e.g., "Selection Sort," "Bubble Sort," etc.) to initiate the sorting process using the selected algorithm.
3. **Watch the Visualization**: The bars will animate as the sorting algorithm progresses, providing a visual representation of how the algorithm rearranges the elements in the array.
4. **Regenerate Array**: If you wish to generate a new random array, click the "Regenerate Array" button. The bars will update to reflect the newly generated array, and you can select a sorting algorithm to observe its execution on the new array.
5. **Stop Sorting**: At any point during the sorting process, you can click the "Stop" button to halt the algorithm's execution. This will reload the page and generate a new random array.

### Supported Sorting Algorithms

The project currently supports the following popular sorting algorithms:

- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Bogo Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort

Feel free to explore the project, experiment with different sorting algorithms, and observe how they sort the array in real-time.
